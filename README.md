Title: Web Security Assessment Tool

Overview
A Python-based command-line tool called the online Security Assessment Tool will be
used to evaluate online applications for common vulnerabilities and enhance their security
posture. This application will use Python modules like Beautiful Soup and Reppy to
automatically assess common security flaws. By pointing up important security holes like
SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which an attacker may use to obtain
unauthorized access or deduce information about the program, it will assist developers
and security analysts. Actionable insights regarding web applications' security
preparedness will be provided by the tool.

Objectives
Vulnerability Detection: The program will look for possible weaknesses in online
applications, such as but not restricted to:
• Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
• SQL Injection (SQLi)
• Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
• Default or absent security headers

Sitemap Generation: By crawling the target website to find all accessible endpoints, the
program will produce an extensive sitemap that will enable a systematic security
evaluation of the entire website.

User-Friendly Command-Line Interface: Both developers and security analysts will be
able to utilize the tool's CLI, which will allow users to start tests and see results without the
requirement for a graphical user interface.

Key Functionalities
1. Website Crawling and Sitemap Generation: The application will create a thorough
sitemap by recursively scanning and collecting all internal URLs on the target page using a
crawler. A systematic summary of the website's accessible endpoints will be produced by
this procedure, which will serve as the basis for additional vulnerability assessments.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection: By inserting popular XSS payloads into input
fields, the tool will test reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities and determine whether the
response reflects the injected script back to the user.

3. SQL Injection Detection: The tool will identify inferable SQL injection vulnerabilities by
inserting SQL-specific payloads into query parameters (for example, 1' OR '1'='1). The URL
will be marked as possibly susceptible if SQL error messages are detected in the response.

4. Detection of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The tool will test for SSRF by using a
localhost URL payload to identify whether the web application allows unauthorized access
to internal resources.

5. Security Header Analysis: To look for crucial security headers like X-Frame-Options,
Content-Security-Policy, and X-Content-Type-Options, HTTP headers will be examined.
Users will be informed about potential locations where security could be improved by
flagging missing or incorrectly configured headers.

Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Requests: For making HTTP requests and handling responses.
Beautiful Soup: For parsing HTML content and extracting relevant data.
Reppy: For handling and analyzing robots.txt files (if needed for SSRF detection).
This is just an idea of what we will use. It may vary in future.

Limitations:
Restricted detection of XSS and SQL Injection: Simple payload injections into input
fields and URLs will serve as the foundation for the XSS and SQL injection detection
systems. By looking at response content, they can identify inferred vulnerabilities (such as
error messages for SQLi and payload reflection for XSS), but they might miss more complex
or obfuscated flaws.

Header Static Analysis: The tool will only analyses HTTP response headers statically to
find security configurations that are either missing or default. Complex, context-dependent
security header concerns might go unnoticed by this method.

No Bypass Testing for Authentication: There won't be any user authentication tests or
ways to get around access controls in this project. If necessary, other modules could be
developed to increase these capabilities.

Only Non-Intrusive Testing: The tool will not use intrusive testing techniques that could
jeopardize stability to prevent disrupting production systems. Passive checks will be
carried out, depending only on the target server's replies.

Conclusion:
With an emphasis on frequently exploited vulnerabilities, the Web Security Assessment
Tool will provide a fundamental yet crucial security evaluation for web applications. It will
give developers and analysts a strong basis for comprehending security flaws, enabling
them to stop possible attacks before they become serious. Being a CLI-based tool, it will be
easy to use and appropriate for quick evaluations. Notwithstanding certain drawbacks, this
application will be a useful supplement to fundamental web security procedures since it
provides a simple method for identifying vulnerabilities.
